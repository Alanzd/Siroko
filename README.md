Coding test for frontend position at Siroko  

## Introduction
This project contains my code test as part of the selection process in Siroko.
A website that displays a two-step form. Upon completion, it redirects to a page where a personalized code is displayed, generated based on the answers provided in the form. This code is valid for 20 minutes, with a countdown timer shown. When the timer reaches 0 seconds, it redirects to a page indicating that the code has expired and offers the option to restart the form.
The project has been developed using JavaScript, HTML and CSS
